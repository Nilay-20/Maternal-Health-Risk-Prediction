# Maternal-Health-Risk-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict maternal health risk levels (Low, Mid, High) based on physiological data using classification models.

Overview:-
Using a dataset from the UCI Repository, this project applies K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest to classify risk levels based on:
Age
Diastolic BP
Blood Sugar
Body Temperature
Heart Rate

Tech Stack:-
Python 
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Results
KNN Accuracy: 83.7%
Random Forest Accuracy: 83.74%
RF outperforms due to better handling of features and ensemble learning.

âœ… Highlights
Preprocessing, EDA, model training, cross-validation
RF provides better consistency and lower RMSE
Useful for early identification of high-risk pregnancies
